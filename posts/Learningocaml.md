In my programming languages class we are learning our first functional language OCaml. This has been quite challenging as after only learning Object oriented programming languages. Through programming in OCaml my thinking has begun to change while solving problems, instead of trying to translate my previous experience from other languages i have to learn a whole new set of tools to solve problems. Instead of for or while loops most iteration is done through recursion and mapping. As I progress further through the language I can see a lot of relation to regular languages and finite automata in the implementation of Ocaml.
